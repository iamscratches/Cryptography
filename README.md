# Cryptography
***Here is how this project works :***
- First let me show around how this project structure is maintained.<img width="490" alt="output1" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35376376/121812796-ef746a00-cc86-11eb-8639-141966e272df.PNG">
- The test.py shows the code on how to use each encryption algorithm. Feel free to look at it for understanding how to work with each encryption algorithms. All the lines are commented initially so uncomment it as per need basis.

***I will show u few of the encryption algorithms at work feel free to test the rest on ur own.***
- First off is the simple caeser cipher.<img width="960" alt="output2" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35376376/121812798-f0a59700-cc86-11eb-8d8a-4c4b7504fd27.PNG">
- The frequency analysis of the original text.<img width="644" alt="output3" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35376376/121812800-f13e2d80-cc86-11eb-9a9e-50a17a377fe8.PNG">
- The frequency analysis of the decrypted text.<img width="644" alt="output4" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35376376/121812801-f13e2d80-cc86-11eb-959a-ac05fbfb39f2.PNG">
- Next off is the deffie-hellman key exchange. It generates a secret key without passing the original key between two entities hence only public key is used along with end-user's private keys to generate a common key which both of them can use as encryption key for other encryptions<img width="960" alt="output5" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35376376/121812803-f1d6c400-cc86-11eb-9489-38a1e4c48357.PNG">
